The graphing gui is relatively simple to use. In order to run the gui you 
must have the same number of inputs and there is outputs. If this is not 
true, then an error bar will pop up. Also on the gui there are y and x, 
minimum and maximum values. If you were to have a minimum value that is 
greater than the maximum value, it will also give you an error. In order
to run the code, you must select run. Once you select a color and line 
type for the graph, it will produce a graph. If you wish to reset the gui,
simply select the reset button to clear the values. Some sample data the
grader can use is : x value ( 4 5 6) and y value (1 2 3). The y max should
be 3 and the y min should be 1. The x max should be 6 and the x min should 
be 4.
